# The macroevolutionary singularity of snakes
---

This repository contains all data and code used to infer the squamate phylogeny, prepare trait and other datasets, run comparative analyses, and generate all main and supplemental figures. README files with additional information are provided within repository subfolders.


## Description of the data and file structure

Data files are provided via Data Dryad and R/Python scripts are provided in the associated Zenodo repository, but the data folder and scripts folder are intended to be placed in a common directory so that file paths in the scripts can point to the appropriate data files.  

Data are organized into several subfolders that are aligned with the different stages of analysis. Scripts generally mirror this structure. 

Code for comparative analyses and main or supplemental figures should be runnable by the user. Code for other stages of analysis are shared for the sake of transparency, but are not runnable as provided. 

Phylogenies can be found in the data repository, in 1.tree_inference > mainTrees

Diversification and trait data can be found in alldat.csv (see associated readme).
