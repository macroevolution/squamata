Tree inference README
=====================

concatenatedAlignment: directory containing the concatenated alignment and partition files
fullTree_constrainedInference_mergeAll: directory containing output files from the tree inference stage where separate family-level trees were merged together into a single tree. This is the tree inference constrained by the genomic backbone.
fullTree_unconstrainedInference_mergeAll: directory containing output files from the tree inference stage where separate family-level trees were merged together into a single tree. This is the tree inference that did not include the genomic backbone constraint.
mainTrees: final constrained and unconstrained molecular trees, and final constrained ultrametric tree.
pseudoposterior: set of 100 pseudo-posterior trees that represent several sources of uncertainty.
